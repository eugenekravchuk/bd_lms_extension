    "How would the Document-Oriented Data Model be characterized?": [
        "The Document-Oriented model resembles Key-Value model",

        "Values in in the Document-Oriented model are indexed and are searchible by their properties",
        "A Document Store is organized as a tree-like structure. The nodes represent document collections, sub-collections, and individual documents",

        "A value could be anything in the Key-Value model, including JASON code, embedded multimedia objects, and links",
        "The values in the Key-Value model are data aggregates that may have different structures"

    "How would a document collection within the Document-Oriented Data Model be characterized?": [
        "A document collection is like a file directory structure in a file system",
        "A document collection could be regarded as a folder for nested sub-collections and individual documents",

    "What are multidimentional data?": [
        "Multidimensional data are data that can be modelled using dimension attributes and measure attributes",
        "Multidimensional data are data that could be represented by a data cube"
    ],

    "What is the Semantic Web? How does it differ from the conventional Web?": [
    "The Semantic Web the infrastructure that enables representing and using the semantics of Web Resources",
    "The Semantic Web is the hypernet of entities like people, books, vehicles, or any other kind.",
    "The Semantic Web is a hypergraph constructed of triples and built on top of the Web",
    "The Semantic Web extends the Web by representing the entities that are are not represented by the Web - like paper books.",
    "The Semantic Web is a media that enables communication between machines",
    "The Semantic Web is the infrastructure in which every resource has formally defined meaning",
    "The Semantic Web is the next generation of the structured Web"

    "What is the difference between object and datatype properties in RDF?": [
        "An object property is the property that connects a resource and a different resource, while a datatype property connects a resource and a value of a particular type",
        "An object property is a semantic relationship between a resource and a resource. A datatype property is the assignment of a value to the property of a resource."
    ],
    "What are the right ways to specify properties in RDF?": [
        "A property could be specified by referring to the instance of a property class",
        "A property could be specified by referring to a literal",
        "A property could be specified by making a resource a sub-class of a class having the desired property"
